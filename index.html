    STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. All 4 factors work together in the world and they all make a great impact and as students develop a deep understanding of scientific principles, technological advancements, engineering design processes, and mathematical concepts they will be able to apply these skills in real-world scenarios. The learning of STEM begins a passion for exploration and discovery. Students are also encouraged to ask questions, conduct experiments, and seek solutions to complex problems. STEM is a hands-on approach which starts the curiosity and keeps a love for learning and solving new problems, an important skill that is needed in the real world.
